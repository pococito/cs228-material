This notebook is supposed to be used interactively, with executable fields. To use it so you need to get jupyter notebook server up and running locally:

* `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`
* `pip install --upgrade jupyter`
* `jupyter notebook`

The notebook is based on an [earlier version](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) prepared by Justin Johnson and then adapted by Volodymyr Kuleshov and Isaac Caswell to .ipynb
